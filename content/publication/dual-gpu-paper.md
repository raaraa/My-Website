abstract = "Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a powerful tool in machine learning area. However, the convolution computation is time-consuming, which limited the application on embedded system. In this paper, we introduce a parallel convolution acceleration implementation by using multiple GPUs Mali-T628 MP6 on embedded system Odroid XU4 and have tested its time reduction and GPU utilization. The result show that the execution time is reduced 25.8% on average."
