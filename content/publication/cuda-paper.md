abstract = "Deep learning neural network is very powerful to deal with signal processing, computer vision and many other recognition problems since its high accuracy. The CUDA based framework is a mainstream in deep learning models. In this paper, we present OpenCL based implementation of the most advanced deep learning framework. Our work shows following contributions: (1) It is a real-time object recognition framework. (2) Our framework can work across variety of compute devices, e.g., Mali and AMD, etc. (3) The framework can be applied in various constraint situations, such as portable devices (embedded system) or low power applications (embedded system and FPGA)."
